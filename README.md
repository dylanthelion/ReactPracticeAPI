## React practice API

This project is intended to provide a functioning API for any developers using the corresponding web project to learn and improve their skills with, React.JS.

There is no need to do development work in this API. Improvements are welcome, but all you need to do to get going, is to scaffold a model.

- Navigate to the project directory, tutorial-api.
- Enter the command 'npm run scaffold <your developer name>/<your model name>'. For example: npm run scaffold njose/loans.
- This should create a folder named njose, and a file within named loans.json. The loans .json file should come prep-populated with a basic model schema and empty data array.

That is all you need. The schema object currently is not used for anything. It is a common need when creating ad hoc databases like this, and is present so that developers may expand on the database functionality, without breaking the app.
